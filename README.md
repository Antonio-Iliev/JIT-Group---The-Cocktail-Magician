# JTGroup FinalProject_tempRepo


to be migrated on gitHub!

Team members: Julia Stoimenova , Todor Karamfilov
Due Date: 28.11.2019
Trello board ???
Technologies used:
-> db ef 2.2 
-> asp.net core mvc 2.2 
-> C#
-> MUST be over 80% test covered ( inMemory, unit) !!! Life-hack: To rise percantage of test coverage at the end of the project
DELETE MIGRATIONS ( then migrate the whole db at once, migrations ruin test statistics) 
-> gitHub (git)
-> front-end ( some ajax to be impl. , theme ) 
-> communicators
